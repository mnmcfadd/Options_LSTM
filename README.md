# Option Pricing Using Neural Networks

**Introduction**

This project intends to was to experiment and test accuracy of standard and composite neural network architectures in options pricing, benchmarked against the Black-Scholes model. Initial model architectures take inspiration from Stanford CS230 Project - [Option Pricing with Deep Learning](https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2019/reports/26260984.pdf). All data used is open-source for this project.
